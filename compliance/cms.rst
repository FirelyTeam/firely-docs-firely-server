Compliance with CMS Advancing Interoperability and Improving Prior Authorization Processes - ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸
===============================================================================================

The CMS Interoperability Rule aims to promote greater interoperability, patient access, and innovation in the healthcare industry, while also improving the quality and cost-effectiveness of care. Technically these goals are supported by multiple APIs that are required to be provided:

* Patient Access API
* Provider Access API
* Provider Directory API
* Payor-to-Payor API
* Prior Authorization Requirements, Documentation and Decision (PARDD) 

Firely Server aims to support all mandatory requirements out-of-the-box. The following ImplementationsGuides built the foundation of the APIs mentioned above.
