    * ``reset`` (see :ref:`feature_resetdb`)
    * ``preload`` (see :ref:`feature_preload`)

    * ``SearchParameter`` (restrict both read and write)
    * ``ValueSet`` (restrict both read and write)
    * ``CodeSystem`` (restrict both read and write)
    * ``CompartmentDefinition`` (restrict both read and write)
