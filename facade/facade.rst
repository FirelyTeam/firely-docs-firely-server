Firely Server Facade
====================

Firely Server Facade is a means to use the Firely Server implementation of the FHIR RESTful API on top of an existing repository.
This repository may be a relational database, a nosql database or even another web api.

This chapter details the two options for setting up a Firely Server Facade, and provides you with an exercise to get
some hands-on experience with a Facade solution.
