The FHIR Specification `operations framework`_ allows for the definition of custom operations and defines how to offer them in the `FHIR RESTful API`_. Firely Server offers various custom operations out of the box, next to :ref:`$export (Bulk Data Export) <feature_bulkdataexport>`, as well as its :ref:`terminology operations <feature_terminology>`:

#. :ref:`feature_patienteverything`
#. :ref:`feature_validation`
#. :ref:`lastn`
#. :ref:`feature_snapshot`
#. :ref:`feature_meta`
#. :ref:`feature_healthcheck`
#. :ref:`erase`
#. :ref:`feature_docref`
#. :ref:`member-match`
