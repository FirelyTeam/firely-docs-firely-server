If you are interested in using a project on `Simplifier <https://docs.fire.ly/projects/Simplifier/>`_ for your conformance resources, you can also quickly spin up a Firely Server instance with the content of this project already loaded. For more information how to do this please see :ref:`Use Firely Server with your Simplifier artifacts <simplifier_docs:simplifier_firely_server>`.
