Welcome to the Firely Server's documentation!
=============================================

`Firely Server <https://fire.ly/products/vonk/>`_ is Firely's FHIR server. It was formerly named 'Vonk' and is the successor to our Spark server.
Firely Server is the answer to the growing need for a stable server that can be used in a variety of production environments.
