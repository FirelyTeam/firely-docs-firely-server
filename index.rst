Welcome to the Firely Server's documentation!
=============================================

`Firely Server <https://fire.ly/products/vonk/>`_ is Firely's FHIR server. It was formerly named 'Vonk' and is the successor to our Spark server.

Firely Server is the answer to the growing need for a stable server that can be used in a variety of production environments.
A public sandbox is available at https://server.fire.ly, which is is free to use and intended for
testing and educational purposes only. For convenience, the public server API can be explored using our Swagger-based `web UI <_static/swagger>`_.

installation, as well as information on how to contact us when you have additional needs, such as a custom implementation
or support contract.
