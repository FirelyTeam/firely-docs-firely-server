Welcome to the Firely Server's documentation!
=============================================

`Firely Server <https://fire.ly/products/vonk/>`_ is Firely's FHIR server. It was formerly named 'Vonk' and is the successor to our Spark server.

Firely Server is the answer to the growing need for a stable server that can be used in a variety of production environments.
A public sandbox is available at https://server.fire.ly, which is is free to use and intended for
testing and educational purposes only.

installation, as well as information on how to contact us when you have additional needs, such as a custom implementation
or support contract.
