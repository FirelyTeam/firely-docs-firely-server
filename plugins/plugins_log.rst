.. _vonk_plugins_log_detail:

Detailed logging of loading plugins
======================================

If your plugin or any of the Firely Server plugins appears not to be loaded correctly, you may inspect what happens in more detail in the log. See :ref:`configure_log` for where you can find the log file.
You can vary the log level for ``Vonk.Core.Pluggability.VonkConfigurer`` to hide or reveal details.

.. _vonk_plugins_log_assemblies:

On the ``Information`` level, Firely Server will tell you which assemblies are loaded and searched for ``VonkConfiguration`` attributes:

::

   Looking for Configuration in these assemblies:
      C:\data\dd18\vonk_preview\Vonk.Administration.Api.dll
      C:\data\dd18\vonk_preview\Vonk.Core.dll
      C:\data\dd18\vonk_preview\Vonk.Fhir.R3.dll

      C:\data\dd18\vonk_preview\plugins\Vonk.Facade.Relational.dll

.. _vonk_plugins_log_pipeline:

Also on the ``Information`` level, Firely Server will show the services and middleware as it has loaded, in order.
The list below is also the default pipeline as it is configured for Firely Server.

It shows all the configuration classes it found, and whether a ConfigureServices and / or a Configure method was found and executed.
It also displays the value of the ``order`` property of the ``VonkConfiguration`` attribute for each configuration class.
This allows you to determine an appropriate order for your own configuration class.

.. _vonk_plugins_log_includes:

On the ``Verbose`` level, Firely Server will also tell you why each configuration class that is found is being included or excluded. An example:
