OpenTelemetry
=============

Firely Auth can be configured to expose OpenTelemetry metrics. By using OpenTelemetry, Firely Auth enables observability into throughout its services based on an open standard. See `What is OpenTelemetry <https://opentelemetry.io/docs/what-is-opentelemetry/>`_ for an introduction to the standard.

Metrics
-------

Firely Auth emits a variety of runtime metrics, building on the Duende IdentityServer metrics. For a full description of the available IdentityServer metrics, see the `Duende IdentityServer OpenTelemetry documentation <https://docs.duendesoftware.com/identityserver/diagnostics/otel/>`_.
See :ref:`feature_opentelemetry` for options to distribute and consume metrics OpenTelemetry export/processing pipeline, or to visualise them in the Firely Performance Dashboard.

The ``OpenTelemetryOptions`` section configures how Firely Auth exposes metrics via OpenTelemetry.

.. code-block:: json

  "OpenTelemetryOptions": {
    "EnableMetrics": false,
    "Endpoint": "<otlp-collector-endpoint>"
  }

- ``EnableMetrics``: true / false â€“ Enables or disables the emission of OpenTelemetry metrics. When set to ``true``, Firely Auth will collect and export metrics as configured.
- ``Endpoint``: Specifies the endpoint of the OpenTelemetry collector to which the traces and metrics will be sent. Replace <otlp-collector-endpoint> with the actual endpoint URL. Note that even though gRPC is used as the exchange protocol for the metrics, the endpoint needs to use http or https as the protocol in the url.
