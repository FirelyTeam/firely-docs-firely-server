.. _configure_memory:

Using the In-Memory storage
===========================

* Navigate to your Firely Server working directory
* Changing a setting means overriding it as described in :ref:`configure_change_settings`. 

* Find the ``Repository`` setting::

	"Repository": "Memory",

* If it is not already set to ``Memory``, do so now.

* You can set SimulateTransactions to "true" if you want to experiment with `FHIR transactions <https://www.hl7.org/fhir/http.html#transaction>`_.
  The In-Memory implementation does not support real transactions, so in case of an error already processed entries will NOT be rolled back::

   "MemoryOptions": {
       "SimulateTransactions": "true"
   },


.. _configure_memory_admin:

Using the In-Memory storage for the Administration API database
---------------------------------------------------------------
This works the same as with the normal Firely Server database, except that you put the settings within the ``Administration`` section

E.g.::

   "Administration": {
       "Repository": "Memory",
       "MemoryOptions": {
           "SimulateTransactions": "false"
       }
   }

.. warning::

   Using the In-Memory storage for the administration layer will cause Firely Server to load the specification files on each startup.
   This takes several minutes, and Firely Server will respond with a '423 - Locked' error to all requests during that time. As of version
   0.7.1 we have implemented support for SQLite, which we recommend to use instead of the In-Memory storage. See :ref:`sqlite_admin_reasons`
   for more information.
